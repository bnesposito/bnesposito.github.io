- **The Effect of Bonuses on Teacher Retention and Student Learning in Rural Schools: A Story of Spillovers** (with [Juan F. Castro](https://sites.google.com/view/juanfcastro/)). <u>Education Finance and Policy</u>. Forthcoming. <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/edfp_a_00348/100731/The-Effect-of-Bonuses-on-Teacher-Retention-and"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> 

  We estimate the direct and indirect effects of recruitment bonuses paid to teachers working in rural schools in Peru on their retention and student learning. This is the first study to estimate the indirect effects of a bonus aimed at attracting teachers to disadvantaged schools. This is important for assessing whether the incentive has improved the distribution of teaching resources and for estimating the direct effect without bias. We exploit the exogenous variation produced in the size of the bonus by the rule used to classify rural schools, and allow ineligible schools to be affected if they have an eligible school nearby. We find the bonus produces positive direct effects on teacher retention but also a negative spillover on the probability of filling teacher vacancies in neighboring schools. This spillover indicates that the bonus is redistributing resources between equally disadvantaged schools. We also find that the bonus has no direct effects on student learning and produces a positive spillover on the scores of students in neighboring schools. We argue these results are due to the poor pedagogical skills of the teachers being mobilized by the scheme. A reasonable policy alternative is a scheme that targets talented teachers with larger bonuses.


## Work in Progress
- **Adaptive Experiments for Policy Choice: Phone Calls for Home Reading in Kenya** (with [Anja Sautmann](https://sites.google.com/site/anjasautmann/home)). [Latest version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJCZQzavbKgGE3n8w4TiGviMq7wi37Vf/view). 

  Adaptive sampling in experiments with multiple waves can improve learning for “policy choice problems” where the goal is to select the optimal intervention or treatment among several options. This paper uses a real-world policy choice problem to demonstrate the advantages of adaptive sampling and propose solutions to common issues in applying the method. The application is a test of six formats for automated calls to parents in Kenya that encourage reading with children at home. The adaptive ‘exploration sampling’ algorithm is used to efficiently identify the call with the highest rate of engagement. Simulations show that adaptive sampling increased the posterior probability of the chosen arm being optimal from 86 to 93 percent and more than halved the posterior expected regret. The paper discusses a range of implementation aspects, including how to decide about research design parameters such as the number of experimental waves.
