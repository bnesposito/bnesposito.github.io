Welcome! I am an economist and statistician. I am also an incoming Economics PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I hold a MSc in Statistics from KU Leuven and a BA in Economics from Universidad del Pacifico. I am interested in econometrics, bayesian statistics and their applications in real world problems.
