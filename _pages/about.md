Welcome! I am an economist and a statistician. I am also an Economics PhD student at the University of British Columbia. I hold a MSc in Statistics from KU Leuven and a BA in Economics from Universidad del Pacifico. 

I am interested in econometrics, bayesian statistics, machine learning and their applications in real world problems.
